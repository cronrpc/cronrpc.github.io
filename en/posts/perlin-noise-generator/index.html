It can generate random patterns with natural-looking texture and is widely used in computer graphics to simulate natural phenomena such as clouds, terrain, fire, wood grain, and water flow2.\nUnlike plain white noise, Perlin Noise has spatial correlation: values at neighboring sample points vary smoothly without abrupt jumps. This smoothness makes the generated textures resemble the continuous variations found in nature.\nMinecraft, for example, uses Perlin Noise as a foundational algorithm to generate its effectively infinite world maps.\nTypes of Noise 1D Uniform White Noise 1D uniform white noise is a one-dimensional noise signal where values follow a uniform distribution.\nimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def sample_random_points(num_points): # Sampler function: return num_points random numbers in the range [0, 1) return np.random.rand(num_points) def draw_random_strip_image_from_samples(rand_1d, width, height, filename, thickness=1): num_points = len(rand_1d) cols_per_point = width // num_points rand_pos = (rand_1d * (height - 1)).astype(int) img = np.zeros((height, width)) for i, row in enumerate(rand_pos): start_row = max(row - thickness, 0) end_row = min(row + thickness + 1, height) start_col = i * cols_per_point end_col = start_col + cols_per_point img[start_row:end_row, start_col:end_col] = 1 plt.imshow(img, cmap='gray', origin='lower') plt.axis('off') plt.show() plt.imsave(filename, img, cmap='gray') if __name__ == \"__main__\": rand_noise = sample_random_points(512) draw_random_strip_image_from_samples(rand_noise, 1024, 512, \"random_noise_1d.png\") For one-dimensional random noise, the generated points have no correlation between them.\nIf we use Perlin Noise instead, we get a continuous and smooth curve.\n2D Uniform White Noise If we randomly generate a noise image with a uniform distribution, the result is uniform white noise: each point has no relation to its neighbors.\nimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Generate a 512x512 random floating-point grayscale image with values in [0, 1) noise = np.random.rand(512, 512) plt.imshow(noise, cmap='gray') plt.axis('off') plt.imsave('random_noise.png', noise, cmap='gray') Completely random white noise:\nPerlin Noise, by contrast, has correlations between neighboring points — adjacent values are required to be close and smooth.\nGaussian White Noise import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Generate 512x512 Gaussian white noise with mean 0.5 and std deviation 0.1 noise = np.random.normal(loc=0.5, scale=0.1, size=(512, 512)) # Clip values to [0, 1] to avoid display artifacts noise = np.clip(noise, 0, 1) plt.imshow(noise, cmap='gray') plt.axis('off') plt.imsave('gaussian_white_noise_2d.png', noise, cmap='gray') plt.show() Because it is not uniformly distributed, Gaussian noise often looks a bit softer than uniform white noise.\nThe Gaussian distribution is even more apparent in one dimension, where a clear central band concentrates most of the points.\n1D Perlin Noise To understand the fractal-related concepts in Perlin Noise, we first need to understand the ideas of fade functions, periodicity, and frequency multipliers (octaves)3.\nFade Given a series of known point values, to estimate values between them we can use linear interpolation to produce straight-line segments or cosine interpolation to produce smooth curves.\nCosine interpolation can be written as:\n$$ x = x1 + (x2-x1) * \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\pi \\alpha)}{2} $$\nThe goal of different interpolation methods is to produce a smooth transition rather than a sharp corner. Besides cosine, cubic, quintic, and other polynomials are commonly used.\nConverting linear interpolation into a smooth interpolation like this is called the Fade operation.\nIn the improved version of his noise algorithm, Perlin used the following Fade function:\n$$ t = 6 t^5 - 15 t^4 + 10 t^3 $$\nOctaves If you repeatedly double the sampling frequency, you obtain functions with halved periods. Because doubling frequency corresponds to musical octaves, these levels are called octaves.\nPerlin Noise is composed by mixing noises of different periods with certain weights.\nTypically, periods are doubled while weights are halved, which introduces a fractal-like concept.\n2D Perlin Noise Generator Algorithm Ken Perlin published an implementation of his improved Perlin Noise on his website4.\nPerlin Noise is a grid-based gradient noise function commonly used to generate natural-looking textures and terrain. The two-dimensional implementation proceeds as follows:\n1. Grid partitioning Divide the 2D space into a regular integer grid. Each grid corner (lattice point) is associated with a random gradient vector (often unit vectors uniformly distributed in direction).\n2. Compute the sample point’s local position Given a sample point $(x, y)$, determine its containing grid cell by computing the integer coordinates $(X, Y)$ of the cell’s lower-left corner:\n$$ X = \\lfloor x \\rfloor, \\quad Y = \\lfloor y \\rfloor $$\nCompute the sample point’s local coordinates relative to the lower-left corner:\n$$ x_{\\text{rel}} = x - X, \\quad y_{\\text{rel}} = y - Y $$\n3. Compute dot products between corner gradients and displacement vectors For the four corners of the cell:\n$$ (X, Y),\\ (X+1, Y),\\ (X, Y+1),\\ (X+1, Y+1) $$\nretrieve each corner’s gradient vector $\\vec{g}$ and compute the dot product between $\\vec{g}$ and the displacement vector $\\vec{d}$ from the corner to the sample point:\n$$ \\text{dot} = \\vec{g} \\cdot \\vec{d} $$\n4. Smooth interpolation Apply a smooth interpolation function (such as Perlin’s fade) along the $x$ and $y$ axes to bilinearly interpolate the four dot products:\n$$ u = \\text{fade}(x_{\\text{rel}}), \\quad v = \\text{fade}(y_{\\text{rel}}) $$\n5. Output noise value The interpolated result is the noise value at the sample point $(x,y)$, typically in the range approximately $[-1, 1]$.\nPython Code Below is an implementation of 2D Perlin Noise in Python.\nimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt permutation = np.array([ 151,160,137,91,90,15, 131,13,201,95,96,53,194,233,7,225,140,36,103,30,69,142,8,99,37,240,21,10,23, 190, 6,148,247,120,234,75,0,26,197,62,94,252,219,203,117,35,11,32,57,177,33, 88,237,149,56,87,174,20,125,136,171,168, 68,175,74,165,71,134,139,48,27,166, 77,146,158,231,83,111,229,122,60,211,133,230,220,105,92,41,55,46,245,40,244, 102,143,54, 65,25,63,161, 1,216,80,73,209,76,132,187,208, 89,18,169,200,196, 135,130,116,188,159,86,164,100,109,198,173,186, 3,64,52,217,226,250,124,123, 5,202,38,147,118,126,255,82,85,212,207,206,59,227,47,16,58,17,182,189,28,42, 223,183,170,213,119,248,152, 2,44,154,163, 70,221,153,101,155,167, 43,172,9, 129,22,39,253, 19,98,108,110,79,113,224,232,178,185, 112,104,218,246,97,228, 251,34,242,193,238,210,144,12,191,179,162,241, 81,51,145,235,249,14,239,107, 49,192,214, 31,181,199,106,157,184, 84,204,176,115,121,50,45,127, 4,150,254, 138,236,205,93,222,114,67,29,24,72,243,141,128,195,78,66,215,61,156,180 ], dtype=np.uint16) p = np.tile(permutation, 2) def grad(hash:int, x:float, y:float)-\u003efloat: grad_vectors = np.array([ [1, 1], [-1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1] ]) # Normalize gradient vectors grad_vectors = grad_vectors / np.linalg.norm(grad_vectors, axis=1)[:, None] g = grad_vectors[hash % 8] return np.dot(g, [x, y]) def lerp(t: float, a: float, b: float)-\u003efloat: return a + t * (b - a) def fade(t: float)-\u003efloat: return t * t * t * (t * (t * 6 - 15) + 10) def get_noise(x:float, y:float): X = int(np.floor(x)) \u0026 255 Y = int(np.floor(y)) \u0026 255 x = x % 1 y = y % 1 u = fade(x) v = fade(y) ## Here we only need to ensure the hash values are unique x1 = p[p[X] + Y] x2 = p[p[X+1] + Y] x3 = p[p[X] + Y + 1] x4 = p[p[X+1] + Y + 1] ## x3 x4 ## x1 x2 ## The direction of each vector is from the integer lattice point towards the noise sample point return lerp(v, lerp(u, grad(x1, x, y), grad(x2, x - 1, y)), lerp(u, grad(x3, x, y - 1), grad(x4, x - 1, y - 1))) def get_perlin_noise(width=256, height=256, scale=8.0, octaves=1, persistence=0.5, lacunarity=2.0): noise_arr = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=np.float32) for i in range(height): for j in range(width): for k in range(octaves): x = (j / width) * scale * (lacunarity ** k) y = (i / height) * scale * (lacunarity ** k) noise_arr[i, j] += (persistence ** k) * get_noise(x, y) return noise_arr fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10, 10)) for octave_count, ax in zip(range(1, 5), axs.flatten()): noise_arr = get_perlin_noise(width=256, height=256, scale=8.0, octaves=octave_count) # Optionally normalize to [0, 1] noise_arr = (noise_arr - noise_arr.min()) / (noise_arr.max() - noise_arr.min()) ax.imshow(noise_arr, cmap='gray') ax.set_title(f'octaves = {octave_count}', fontsize=14) ax.axis('off') plt.tight_layout() plt.savefig('perlin_noise_octaves_1_to_4.png') How to improve gradient values Using fixed gradient directions instead of gradients produced by a fully uniform random hash helps avoid directional bias that degrades the natural appearance5.\nIn the original approach, gradient directions were uniformly distributed over the sphere. However, a cube is not a sphere: projections along coordinate axes are shorter while diagonal directions are longer.\nThis asymmetry in direction can cause a sparse clustering effect: when several nearby gradients that are nearly axis-aligned happen to point the same way, those regions can show anomalously high values.\nIn his improved version, Perlin suggested choosing gradients like:\n$$ (1,1,0),(-1,1,0),(1,-1,0),(-1,-1,0), (1,0,1),(-1,0,1),(1,0,-1),(-1,0,-1), (0,1,1),(0,-1,1),(0,1,-1),(0,-1,-1) $$\nTo avoid the cost of dividing by 12, he expanded the set to 16 directions by adding $(1,1,0),(-1,1,0),(0,-1,1),(0,-1,-1)$.\nThis article follows that idea: it uses eight planar directions for gradients, and each gradient is normalized to unit length.\nFor one-dimensional Perlin Noise, you can omit normalization to increase variation. A 1D Perlin Noise can be seen as sampling a 2D Perlin Noise along a line through the lattice; lattice points off the line have zero weight and the result is equivalent to the 1D case. In that situation, the projection of a diagonal gradient onto the horizontal axis is not 1 but $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nImproving the Fade function Perlin5 proposed replacing the fade function with a smoother polynomial (the quintic above).\nThe reason is: if the second derivative is not smooth, when used to displace surfaces you can see obvious blocky artifacts.\nSo it’s best to follow these principles:\nAt 0 and 1, derivatives should be 0 so transitions are as smooth as possible. Higher-order derivatives can also be made zero. $ f(0) = 0 $ $ f(1) = 1 $ Examples / Applications Python Noise Library In practice, you rarely need to implement Perlin Noise from scratch — the Python noise library can generate Perlin Noise directly.\nimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from noise import pnoise2 width, height = 512, 512 scale = 64.0 # Controls the \"stretch\" of the noise; larger values make changes occur more slowly octaves = 6 persistence = 0.5 lacunarity = 2.0 noise = np.zeros((height, width)) for y in range(height): for x in range(width): nx = x / scale ny = y / scale noise[y][x] = pnoise2(nx, ny, octaves=octaves, persistence=persistence, lacunarity=lacunarity, repeatx=1024, repeaty=1024, base=0) # Perlin noise is typically in approximately [-1, 1]; normalize to [0, 1] noise = (noise - noise.min()) / (noise.max() - noise.min()) plt.imshow(noise, cmap='gray') plt.axis('off') plt.imsave('perlin_noise_2d_lib.png', noise, cmap='gray') plt.show() Because it is optimized, generation is very fast:\nClouds Use Perlin Noise to simulate simple cloud textures.\nSimulate the dissipating edges of clouds.

href=#introduction-to-perlin-noise>#</a></h2><p>Perlin Noise was developed by Ken Perlin in 1983 for the film <em>Tron</em> as a smooth pseudo-random noise algorithm<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. It can generate random patterns with natural-looking texture and is widely used in computer graphics to simulate natural phenomena such as clouds, terrain, fire, wood grain, and water flow<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><p>Unlike plain white noise, Perlin Noise has spatial correlation: values at neighboring sample points vary smoothly without abrupt jumps. This smoothness makes the generated textures resemble the continuous variations found in nature.</p><p>Minecraft, for example, uses Perlin Noise as a foundational algorithm to generate its effectively infinite world maps.</p><h2 id=types-of-noise>Types of Noise<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#types-of-noise>#</a></h2><h3 id=1d-uniform-white-noise>1D Uniform White Noise<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1d-uniform-white-noise>#</a></h3><p>1D uniform white noise is a one-dimensional noise signal where values follow a uniform distribution.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=kn>import</span> <span class=nn>numpy</span> <span class=k>as</span> <span class=nn>np</span>

However, a cube is not a sphere: projections along coordinate axes are shorter while diagonal directions are longer.</p><p>This asymmetry in direction can cause a sparse clustering effect: when several nearby gradients that are nearly axis-aligned happen to point the same way, those regions can show anomalously high values.</p><p><img alt="anomalously high values" loading=lazy src=/en/posts/perlin-noise-generator/anomalously-high-values.png></p><p>In his improved version, Perlin suggested choosing gradients like:</p><p>$$
(1,1,0),(-1,1,0),(1,-1,0),(-1,-1,0),
(1,0,1),(-1,0,1),(1,0,-1),(-1,0,-1),
(0,1,1),(0,-1,1),(0,1,-1),(0,-1,-1)
$$</p><p>To avoid the cost of dividing by 12, he expanded the set to 16 directions by adding $(1,1,0),(-1,1,0),(0,-1,1),(0,-1,-1)$.</p><p>This article follows that idea: it uses eight planar directions for gradients, and each gradient is normalized to unit length.</p><p>For one-dimensional Perlin Noise, you can omit normalization to increase variation. A 1D Perlin Noise can be seen as sampling a 2D Perlin Noise along a line through the lattice; lattice points off the line have zero weight and the result is equivalent to the 1D case. In that situation, the projection of a diagonal gradient onto the horizontal axis is not 1 but $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.</p><h3 id=improving-the-fade-function>Improving the Fade function<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#improving-the-fade-function>#</a></h3><p>Perlin<sup id=fnref1:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> proposed replacing the fade function with a smoother polynomial (the quintic above).</p><p>The reason is: if the second derivative is not smooth, when used to displace surfaces you can see obvious blocky artifacts.</p><p><img alt=Noise-displaced loading=lazy src=/en/posts/perlin-noise-generator/Noise-displaced.png></p><p>So it&rsquo;s best to follow these principles:</p><ul><li>At 0 and 1, derivatives should be 0 so transitions are as smooth as possible.
